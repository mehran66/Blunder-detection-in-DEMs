# Gross error detection in Digital Elevation models Using Metahuristic Algorithms
Gross error detection in DEMs is a great concern in geospatial data analysis. Statistical techniques are sensitive to the presence of gross errors, but there are many ambiguities in the results. This project presents a new algorithm for detecting gross errors using Metaheuristic algorithms, i.e., the Genetic, Bee colony, Ant colony, Particle Swarm Optimization, Cat Swarm Optimization, Tabu search, and Hill Climbing. The proposed methods are characterized by a common localization procedure: The dataset is devided into subsets and is examined iteratively; using a moving square window. In each window, bilinear surface is fitted to all surrounding points and the residuals are estimated for each point. The cost function tris to minimum sum of squared residuals. Three simulation studies are conducted to verify the proposed methods. The results are compraed with the outcoms of geostatistical toolbox in ArcMap software. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective and more accuratein detecting single and cluster blunders.
